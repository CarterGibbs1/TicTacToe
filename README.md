# TicTacToe
This is a personal project of mine. I implemented a MinMax algorithm to show how TicTacToe is a fixed game.

OVERVIEW:

The program is an implementation of a MinMax Algorithm for AI to play TicTacToe perfectly.


INCLUDED FILES:

TicTacToe.java

COMPILING AND RUNNING:


 From the directory containing all the source files, compile
 the driver class with the command:

 To compile TicTacToe:
$ javac TicTacToe.java

 Run the compiled class with the commands:

 To run TicTacToe:
$ java TicTacToe.java

 Console output will give the results after the program finishes.

PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

The TicTacToe class runs a certain number of simulations of AI playing itself in TicTacToe. Every game should draw since it is a fixed game.
It uses an algorithm that one player is trying to maximize their wins, and the other player is trying to minimize their opponents wins.

TESTING:

I ran multiple simulations to make sure each game is played correctly.

DISCUSSION:
 
I solely used an explanation video and Wikipedia of the algorithm. I tried to interpret it using only those two resources so I could build it from the ground up.
